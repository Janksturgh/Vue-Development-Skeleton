# Vue-Development-Skeleton

## About this project
The basic usage for this project came about with the need to have a quick
codebase that can run VueJS on a node express server, with the goal in mind to
quickly build a website that consumes an API to render dynamic data to the frontend.

### Tech used
- Bulma.io - CSS Framework  
- Express - Node.js Framework  
- VueJS - Javascript Framework  
- Webpack  
- Axios  

Webpack Dev Middlesware & Webpack Hot Middleware is also used to work
with the Express server and allow for hot reloading alongside file change watchers.

This project also comes installed with the Vue Router for a quick setup of
routing and Vue Axios as a lightweight wrapper around Axios.
