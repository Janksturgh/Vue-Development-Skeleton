# Vue-Development-Skeleton

## About this project
The basic usage for this project came about with the need to have a quick
codebase that can run VueJS on a node express server, with the goal in mind to
quickly build a website that consumes an API to render dynamic data to the frontend.

### Tech used
- Bulma.io - CSS Framework  
- Express - Node.js Framework  
- VueJS - Javascript Framework  
- Webpack

Webpack Dev Middlesware & Webpack Hot Middleware is also used to work
with the Express server and allow for hot reloading.

This project also comes installed with the Vue Router for a quick setup of
routing and Vue Axios as a lightweight wrapper around Axios.
